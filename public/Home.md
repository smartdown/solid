### Welcome to Smartdown on Solid

This is an experiment that stores [Smartdown](https://smartdown.io) documents in a [Solid](https://solid.github.io/information/) POD, and enables those documents to be rendered via a Smartdown viewer app that is hosted on the same POD. The source for this project is at [smartdown/solid](https://github.com/smartdown/solid).

#### Smartdown Basics

Smartdown is a javascript library that interprets and renders Smartdown documents in a web browser. These documents are syntactically just ordinary Markdown, but Smartdown interprets the code block syntax in a way that optionally allows code (whether Javascript, Graphviz, or some other DSL) to become *playable* within the context of the page. This is augmented with an overloading of Markdown's URL syntax that enables input/output *cells* to be displayed and interacted with. The playables and cells communicate *reactively* via Smartdown variables that underly the page.


#### Smartdown Tunnels

Typically, a Smartdown project (aka notebook) is stored in one or more markdown files (usually with `.md` or `.markdown` extension) that I sometimes call *cards*. There is a URL syntax that enables one card to create a clickable link button to another card (I call it a *tunnel* to distinguish it from a link). A user clicking this will replace the content of the current card with the content of the linked-to card. This results in a single-page-app experience, but more importantly, state variables are maintained between these *tunnel* transitions, which enables multicard experiences to be authored more easily.


#### Smartdown on Solid

Smartdown is a Markdown-compatible language for authoring interactive documents. It resembles Jupyter, but has a version-compatible source format, and requires no server to remain interactive. Good for experimenting with, integrating and discussing other technology. Solid complements Smartdown nicely, by providing a *place* to store documents, and an *identity* to enable controlled access (read and write) to this data.

Because Smartdown uses `XMLHttpRequest` to load its documents, a Smartdown project can be stored anywhere on the web that is HTTPS-accessible (and that supports CORS). Typically, I use GitHub to store my Smartdown content, and I have a separate web application that uses Smartdown to load and render this content.

With Solid, I can store and edit the Smartdown docs in the context of Solid's POD and Data Browser, and I can host the viewer web app in Solid. More importantly, I can store data in the POD that can be accessed and visualized by Smartdown playables. For examples of Solid-specific Smartdown usage, see:

#### Testing out Inter-POD Tunnels

Smartdown allows us to have a card-at-a-time view (similar to Hypercard), but allows those cards to be fetched from arbitrary URLs. Let's see if we can *tunnel* to a different POD and then back again.
